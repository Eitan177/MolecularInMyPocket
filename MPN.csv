Biomarker,Specific Alterations/ Alternative Terms,Indications,Result Interpretation/Significance
BCR/ABL1,"Philadelphia (Ph) Chromosome
Usually p210 fusions - e13a2 and e14a2 Rarely p190 fusion - e1a2  or p230 fusion - e19a2 or fusions involving a3","Diagnosis and monitoring of CML
Diagnosis of other MPNs and MDS/MPNs which require exclusion of CML by negative BCR/ABL1
Therapy: ABL1 kinase inhibitors","Diagnostic of CML in the correct clinical context. Also found in some ALLs and AMLs.
Reported in International Scale (% IS), used for monitoring CML"
JAK2,"p.V617F activating hotspot
Exon 12 activating substitution mutations","Diagnosis:
p.V617F for first line single gene testing for PV (95%), ET (50-70%), and PMF (30-50%)
Exon 12 mutations (~5% of  PV)
Therapy: JAK2 inhibitors","p.V617F not specific for a single disease can be found in a wide range of myeloid neoplasms, associated with thrombosis and erythrocytosis High VAF (>75%) is associated with disease
progression"
CALR,Exon 9 frameshift mutations,"Diagnosis:
CALR exon 9 frameshift in ET (25-30%) and PMF (30-35%)",Exon 9 frameshift not specific for a single disease but are useful to support a diagnosis of ET or PMF
MPL,p.W515K/L activating hotspot,"Diagnosis:
MPL p.W515K/L in ET (5%) and PMF (5-10%)","p.W515K/L not specific for a single disease but are
useful to support a diagnosis of ET or PMF"
CSF3R,"p.T618I activating hotspot Other activating substitutions, predominantly exon 17","Diagnosis: CNL (100%), other myeloid neoplasms Therapy:
p.T618I - possible ruxolitinib sensitivity p.S783fs* - possible dasatinib sensitivity","Mutated in nearly all cases of CNL as well as in other myeloid neoplasms
Specific mutations suggest therapy"
FIP1L1/PDGFRA,Usually cryptic deletion involving CHIC2,"Diagnosis: identify specific subtype of neoplasms Therapy response:
PDGFRA/B fusions are typically responsive to kinase inhibitors such as imatinib
FGFR1 fusions are typically non-responsive to imatinib and may need newer agents","Fusions involving PDGFRA/B, FGFR1, and JAK2 are diagnostic of a specific subgroup of lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia that are considered in a distinct category from MPNs, but may be considered in the differential of CEL"
PDGFRB/various partners,"Various fusion partners, most commonly
ETV6",,
FGFR1/various partners,Various fusion partners,,
PCM1-JAK2,"Also includes other partners of JAK2 (e.g.,
ETV6 or BCR)",,
"Panel testing including JAK2, CALR, MPL, CSF3R, ASXL1, TET2, EZH2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, TP53, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, CBL, N/KRAS, SETBP1,
others","For a more complete list of recommended panel options, see numerous other papers, reviewed in McClure et al. Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, pending publication","Clonality may be used to support a diagnosis of an MPN in the correct clinical/pathologic context (e.g., triple negative MPNs, CEL vs HES)
Specific patterns may suggest other entities
SF3B1 mutations may suggest MDS-RS or MDS/MPN-RS-T
CBL mutations may suggest CMML","Provides diagnostic information to support single gene testing
Adds additional prognostic information (e.g., ASXL1 or TP53 mutations or high number of mutations portend poor prognosis)
May suggest pending progression (e.g., NRAS
mutations, elevated JAK2 VAF)"
