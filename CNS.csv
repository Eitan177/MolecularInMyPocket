IDH1 IDH2,"IDH1: Mutations in codon R132
IDH2: Mutations in codons R140, R172",Diagnosis Prognosis,"Can be seen in astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma.
Associated with improved prognosis except when the tumor also has a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B","NGS, Sanger sequencing, genotyping, PCR-based assays, IHC",
1p/19q co-deletion,Deletion,Diagnosis Prognosis,"Co-deletion of 1p/19q is seen in oligodendrogliomas and is associated with
improved prognosis.","FISH, array, NGS",
BRAF,Mutations in codon V600; fusions,"V600 mutations are therapeutic: Fusions such as BRAF- KIAA1549 are more
diagnostic","Seen in tumors such as pilocytic astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, ganglioglioma. Activating mutations or fusions are potentially targetable.","NGS, Sanger sequencing, genotyping, PCR-based assays, IHC, RT-PCR, AMP",
H3-3A H3C2,Mutations in codons K27 and G34,Diagnosis,"Seen in Diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, and Diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34–mutant","NGS, Sanger sequencing, genotyping, PCR-based assays, IHC",
TERT,Promoter mutation,Prognosis,"Associated with less favorable prognosis in IDH- wild type astrocytomas and present in almost all
oligodendrogliomas.","NGS, pyrosequencing, Sanger sequencing, genotyping,
PCR-based assays",
MGMT,Promoter methylation,Therapeutic,Associated with response to temozolomide,"Methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite real-time PCR, bisulfite sequencing",
ATRX,Loss of function mutations,Diagnosis,"Associated with the presence of IDH1 or IDH2
mutations.
Typically mutually exclusive with 1p/19q co-
deletion","NGS, pyrosequencing, Sanger sequencing, IHC",
RELA,Fusion,Diagnosis Prognosis,"RELA-fusion positive ependymomas (usually supratentorial) tend to show more aggressive
behavior.","RT-PCR, AMP, FISH",
"EGFR
chromosome 7
chromosome 10",EGFR amplification Gain of chromosome7 Loss of chromosome 10,Diagnosis,"If a histologic grade 2 or 3, IDH-wildtype astrocytoma has any one of the following three molecular alterations, then is classified as a glioblastoma:  EGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation, or combined gain of chromosome 7
and loss of chromosome 10.","FISH, array, NGS",
